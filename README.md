this is an app designed to help a user create and keep track of recipes. it includes the ability to delete recipes as well.

the recipes are stored as a table that displayes the name of the dish, which style of cuisine the dish is, a photo of the dish, 
as well as ingredients required and a preparation method for the dish. 

the app itself was a project used within the Thinkful curriculum to help show knowledge of React and the useState hook.
